## About The Project
**Data Collection** is one of the early steps during data science project. As the name suggest, the purpose of this stage is to collect relevant data from any sources, such as database, API, websites, or third-party service. Commonly, for established companies, the data needed has been stored in the relational database and to fetch the data from database, you will need SQL (Structured Query Language). No wonder, the SQL has been main requirement for Data Analyst or Data Scientist positions in many companies. Aside from fetching data from database, SQL is also useful for fetching only the data needed and doing prior basic analysis using SQL only.

Knowing the high demand of SQL skill, I feel the need to create a portfolio project to demonstrate my SQL skills. The end-product of this project is to create a web dashboard where there are set of questions related to each database provided and set of answers in form of data table fetched from database using SQL query only. So, in other words, each questions about the dataset in database will be answered by providing data from database using SQL query only.The web dashboard can be seen in [here](http://sql-dashboard.yosiadityan.xyz/).

Currently, there is only one dataset provided with its own set of questions and answers. But, this dashboard will be updated in the future with more dataset and its set of questions and answers as well! :smile:

## The Dataset
The dataset used in this project is obtained from various sources:
- **FIFA World Cup**: Obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/abecklas/fifa-world-cup), contained three datasets: WorldCupMatches.csv, WorldCupPlayers.csv (_not used_), and WorldCup.csv. The dataset used has been through data cleaning process before used on the dashboard. The code for data cleaning process can be seen in this repository
